        I am Krish Lambah, co-founder of Overbooked! I am in grade 9 in the Cathedral and John Connon School. I love reading and have always had more books than I can fit in my shelf. I know that there are many others like me. I have created Overbooked to help all of us give away the books we no longer have use for. Through Overbooked, I want to create a community of people who would like to recycle their books and help preserve the environment at the same time.         
        <br />
        Enjoy reading!

        I am Rhea Lambah, co-founder of Overbooked! I am a senior in the Cathedral and John Connon School. I joined my brother Krish in creating this platform. I have always wanted to see my used books being of relevance to others, as against sitting on my shelf. Through Overbooked, we will target creating a book reading community, that benefits from each other and also helps in keeping our planet more green! 
        <br />
        Letâ€™s have fun and read more!
