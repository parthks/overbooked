        I am Krish Lambah , the founder of Overbooked! I am in grade 9 in the Cathedral and John Connon School. I love reading and have always had more books than I can fit in my shelf. I know that there are many others like me. I have created Overbooked to help all of us give away the books we no longer have use for. Through Overbooked, I want to create a community of people who would like to recycle their books and help preserve the environment at the same time.
